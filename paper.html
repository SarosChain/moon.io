 Token Generation (TGE)
The Token Creation Event is when a project token is issued on the blockchain and sent or made available for claim to users, who get allocated, according to the purchase price.

SAROS TOKENS :
 will serve as the project governance token. Tokens will be issued at the Token Creation Event and offered to investors.

                
LIGHT Tokens :
 will serve as the game's grand prize token. This will be used for the in-game economy. It will be cleared by the system, when the user completes their task, and sent to them as a reward, according to their NFT Rank and Level. It is used as in-game currency to buy level-ups, feed pets, as well as a number of other upgrades.
Giving
The vesting period, also called the token payout period, refers to the period of time during which tokens purchased in an investment round are prevented from being sold for a certain period of time.
pet ID
 Pet is a unique signature image that will help players find other users' pets on social media.
Socialize to Earn :
Outreach is an innovative mechanic that involves using social media platforms to perform daily tasks to earn token rewards. Users must have an IguVerse NFT in their collection to gain access to these tasks.
Move to Get
 Move is the newest variation of the Play-to-Earn mechanism where the user has to walk a certain distance in a certain amount of time to get a prize.
Play to Earn :
Play is a mechanic that rewards users with tokens for playing games and performing certain actions.
The rise of blockchains as a new Internet infrastructure has led to developers deploying tens of thousands of decentralized applications at rapidly growing rates. Unfortunately, blockchain usage is not yet ubiquitous due to frequent outages, high costs, low throughput limits, and numerous security concerns. To enable mass adoption in the web3 era, blockchain infrastructure needs to follow the path of cloud infrastructure as a trusted, scalable, cost-efficient, and continually improving platform for building widely-used applications.

We present the SAROS blockchain, designed with scalability, safety, reliability, and upgradeability as key principles, to address these challenges. The SAROS blockchain has been developed over the past three years by over 350+ developers across the globe. It offers new and novel innovations in consensus, smart contract design, system security, performance, and decentralization. The combination of these technologies will provide a fundamental building block to bring web3 to the masses:

First, the SAROS blockchain natively integrates and internally uses the Move language for fast and secure transaction execution. The Move prover, a formal verifier for smart contracts written in the Move language, provides additional safeguards for contract invariants and behavior. This focus on security allows developers to better protect their software from malicious entities.
Second, the SAROS data model enables flexible key management and hybrid custodial options. This, alongside transaction transparency prior to signing and practical light client protocols, provides a safer and more trustworthy user experience.
Third, to achieve high throughput and low latency, the SAROS blockchain leverages a pipelined and modular approach for the key stages of transaction processing. Specifically, transaction dissemination, block metadata ordering, parallel transaction execution, batch storage, and ledger certification all operate concurrently. This approach fully leverages all available physical resources, improves hardware efficiency, and enables highly parallel execution.
Fourth, unlike other parallel execution engines that break transaction atomicity by requiring upfront knowledge of the data to be read and written, the SAROS blockchain does not put such limitations on developers. It can efficiently support atomicity with arbitrarily complex transactions, enabling higher throughput and lower latency for real-world applications and simplifying development.

Fifth, the SAROS modular architecture design supports client flexibility and optimizes for frequent and instant upgrades. Moreover, to rapidly deploy new technology innovations and support new web3 use cases, the SAROS blockchain provides embedded on-chain change management protocols.
Finally, the SAROS blockchain is experimenting with future initiatives to scale beyond individual validator performance: its modular design and parallel execution engine support internal sharding of a validator and homogeneous state sharding provides the potential for horizontal throughput scalability without adding additional complexity for node operators.
